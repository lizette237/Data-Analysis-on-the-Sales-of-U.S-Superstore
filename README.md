From the above analysis, the least profit margin of U.S Superstore was generated in 2014. However, in 2015, there was a remarkable increase by 2.9% i.e it increases from 10.2% in 2014 to 13.1% in 2015 indicating progress in the U.S Superstore. The highest profit margin was experienced in 2016 meaning 13.4%  of the total Revenue for that year made up the company's profit. Comparing the profit margin between 2015 and 2016, only 0.3% revenue for 2016 made up the company's profit. It also implies that, if strategies are not put in place to curb this situation, the company may likely be stagnant in the nearest future and if possible start regressing which is the case of 2017. In 2017, only 12.7% of the Store's total revenue contributed to it's profit indicating 0.7%  decrease from 2016 -2017.Averagely, the store had as it profit margin 12.5% for the past four years which isn't bad but needs to improve. As a recommendation, U.S superstore should cut all unnecessary expenditures by reducing overhead (Overhead refers to the ongoing costs to operate a business but excludes the direct costs associated with creating a product or service) and production costs. There should also be  an insignificant increase in the pricing of the company's product so that consumers won't feel the impact.
