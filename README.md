From the above analysis, the least profit margin of U.S Superstore was generated in 2014. However, in 2015, there was a remarkable increase by 2.9% i.e it increases from 10.2% in 2014 to 13.1% in 2015 indicating progress in the U.S Superstore. The highest profit margin was experienced in 2016 meaning 13.4%  of the total Revenue for that year made up the company's profit. Comparing the profit margin between 2015 and 2016, only 0.3% revenue for 2016 made up the company's profit. It also implies that, if strategies are not put in place to curb this situation, the company may likely be stagnant in the nearest future and if possible start regressing which is the case of 2017. In 2017, only 12.7% of the Store's total revenue contributed to it's profit indicating 0.7%  decrease from 2016 -2017.Averagely, the store had as it profit margin 12.5% for the past four years which isn't bad but needs to improve. As a recommendation, U.S superstore should cut all unnecessary expenditures by reducing overhead (Overhead refers to the ongoing costs to operate a business but excludes the direct costs associated with creating a product or service) and production costs. There should also be  an insignificant increase in the pricing of the company's product so that consumers won't feel the impact.

West Region contributed 32% to total sales and 38% to total profit being the overall best as compared to other regions, followed by East with 30% and 32% to total sales and profit with Central and South Regions being the least. Marketting Strategies should  implemented to improve on the productivity of the Central and South Regions.

From January to April in both years, Sales haven't really been good. Between June and November 2017, there was a steady increase in sales as compared to same months in 2016. Sales Drop drastically in December 2017 while that of 2016 increased by $17,488. Looking at it yearly, Sales in 2017 were better off than that of 2016 and if more strategies are implemented;the company would be in a better situation in 2018.

### Top ten customers

The Customer who contributed greatly to the sales of the company is Sean Miller with just 50 items bought. Looking at the relationship between quantity bought and revenue generated, one is tempted to say that the Quantity of goods sold is not a major determinant to the revenue. A customer can order just one item but far more expensive than 100 items bought by another customer thereby having a positive impact on the company's revenue.

## Conclusions and Recommendations 
The overall profit margin of the store is not bad but company can do better if they continue with the trend of 2017.

## Recommendations
-Company should invest more in consumer Segment 
- Discounts should be given to clients buying anything related to technolgy in the city of Lancaster in Ohio state. Persuasive advertisement should be carried out in this area too.
- Customers of the month/ year should be identified and appreciated. This will serve as a form of motivation to others thereby increasing the sales of the Company.
